## Machine learning

During my physics career at CERN, I have applied machine learning methods extensively in data selection and processing tasks. My work has included the use of XGBoost for signal selection (binary classification), and the determination of decay kinematics in cases where not all particles are reconstructed (regression). As co-founder of the environmental start-up [Plastic-i Ltd](https://www.plastic-i.com/), I have also begun exploring the use of computer vision methods for detecting ocean plastics with satellite imagery. 

Machine learning continues to find applications across a wide range of academic and industrial fields, thanks to the explosion in big data, the availability of affordable cloud computing resources, and the development of cutting-edge open-source software such as [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). Deep learning in particular is enjoying a prolific period of growth, with the advent of models such as [DALLÂ·E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) for image generation from text captions, and ever-improving libraries of powerful [pre-trained models](https://huggingface.co/).

In this [notebook](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), I explore the application of NLP models in Keras, as I aim to replicate the 2017 paper [PubMed 200k RCT: a Dataset for Sequenctial Sentence Classification in Medical Abstracts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06071).
